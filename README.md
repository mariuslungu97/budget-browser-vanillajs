# budget-browser-vanillajs
A Vanilla Javascript application which helps you to keep track of your budget.

This browser application uses Javascript ES5, CSS and HTML to calculate the total income, expenses and final budget of an user as soon as a new element, including its description and value, is introduced in the system.

The projects consists in an extensive use of DOM manipulation, event listeners, event delegation, data structures such as arrays and basic module patterns.

During the course of this project, I increased my ability to structure the architecture of an application, as well as learn how to approach and solve different coding problems.
